##Why I am taking this course:
I am finishing up my focus in Environmnetal Data Science. I am hoping to continue practicing the skills I have already developed, as well as learn some new ones.

##My data science background:
My experience with data science began at Bren. I have taken ESM 206 and Advanced Data Analysis, as well as GIS and Advanced GIS. I have also taken Conservation Planning. My group project was related to fisheries and climate change, so I have spent the last year writing fisheries models in R, including functions and loops.
